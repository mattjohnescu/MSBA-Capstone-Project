# **Predictive Maintenance for Swire Coca-Cola**

---

## **Business Problem**  
Swire Coca-Cola operates plants across 13 states, but these facilities can only meet 94.4% of the product demand. A significant contributor to this shortfall is unplanned downtime caused by various failure modes, including maintenance, mechanical failures, and general wear and tear. This downtime results in extensive repairs and work orders in the IWC system, leading to long lead times and costing Swire Coca-Cola $60 million annually in production losses.

The objective of this project was to build a predictive model to identify which machines or parts contribute the most to total downtime, quantify their impact as a cost, and provide actionable insights to optimize plant maintenance and prevent future failures.

## **Solution**  
To tackle this problem, our team utilized both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to assess machine failure data. My specific focus was on the supervised modeling process, where we employed a lasso regression to identify features most correlated with machine downtime. Using the insights from this model, we pinpointed production lines, machines, and parts that contributed disproportionately to downtime. 

Our findings, combined with industry expertise in canning and bottling lines, translated into actionable strategies to reduce downtime. These included implementing preventative maintenance schedules for high-risk parts and optimizing existing maintenance plans to minimize lead times.

## **My Contribution**  
I played a key role in the project, particularly in the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, where I visualized and uncovered relationships in the data. My work in early feature analysis guided the team toward developing the lasso regression model. During the modeling process, I contributed to refining the dataset by reducing its size and cleaning it for better interpretability. 

In the final presentation, I presented the results of the lasso regression, explaining how specific features—such as parts and production line locations—were connected to downtime, providing clear and actionable insights to the business.

## **The Value of Our Solution**  
Our solution provided Swire Coca-Cola with specific, actionable insights to address downtime in production. By identifying high-risk parts and production line locations, the company gained a clear path to implement preventative maintenance measures and streamline existing maintenance plans. The depth of our feature analysis ensured that our recommendations were easily interpretable and directly tied to business actions, maximizing their practical value.

## **Difficulties Encountered**  
- **Data Sparsity**: The initial dataset contained 1.6 million observations, which we had to reduce to just over 60,000 to achieve interpretable results.  
- **Model Selection**: Determining the most effective model for actionable business insights was challenging and required extensive evaluation.

## **What I Learned**  
This project highlighted the importance of teamwork and the enjoyment I find in discussing data-related challenges. Collaborating with my team to tackle this complex dataset was an engaging and rewarding experience. I also learned valuable skills in reducing and cleaning large datasets and ensuring that such preprocessing is accounted for when forming a solution to prevent convoluted results.
