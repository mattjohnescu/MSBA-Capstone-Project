# Predictive Maintenance for Swire Coca-Cola

## Business Problem: 
from 13 different states. These plants are currently only able to meet 94.4% of the demand. One of the reasons these plants fall short of meeting the total product demand is that they are plagued with unplanned downtime. This downtime is caused by various failure modes like maintenance, mechanical failure, general wear and tear, etc. 
 
Extensive repairs result in lengthy downtimes that generate work orders in the IWC system.  The long lead times caused by these work orders cost Swire Coca-Cola $60 million annually in production losses.


The purpose of this project is to build a predictive model to identify which machines or parts affect total downtime the most. We also want to quantify this as a cost.   
 
The purpose of this project is to create a predictive model to identify machines at risk of failure to prevent downtime and optimize Swire Coca-Cola's plant machine maintenance.
